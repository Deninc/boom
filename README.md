## Boom

## 31th Jan, 2015

Adding some game logics like characters now can't escape the screen and when a character is near a bomb explosion, 1 live is deducted. When the live is zero, the game resets the live to 3 and play some blink animations. The other thing is the improvement of the control, player now can press the keys to perform continuous movement instead of 1 at a time like before.
